# Sublime_Awesome_plugin
Since our ultimate goal is to help developers and this is what inspired us to develop this plugin for sublime. This plugin for sublime helps users search for code snippets without leaving the editor. That is, this plugin provides an easy way to search for code snippets on Github and Stackoverflow. It is very easy to use: user selects the text or some part of code (i.e function definition) and he has to hit right click and select wherever he wants  to search (i.e Github or Stackoverflow). Whoa! You got the code. It is that easy. 

# Future Enhancements
Our main focus in this project is to provide an easiest way to find out the best relavant code. In future we will add a functionality that will allow users to search for code in editor itself. That is, upon selecting code/text and hitting Search option it will show the top 5 most relavant code snippets. If user finds any one of them the best match, he/she can find whole snippets by clicking on "View More".
